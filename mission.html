        <h1>Our Mission</h1>
        <p>Steven Wu is a former corporate lawyer, personal trainer, and teacher. As a lawyer, he worked with Tencent Holdings, Supercell, Focus Media, Bona Film Group, and other technology and media companies in Asia on both equity and debt offerings.</p>
      
        <p>While working as a lawyer, he observed that many social media sites were driven by a strong incentive to show users personally and societally destructive content to boost engagement and advertising revenue. He believes that the widespread use of parental controls to block social media in Silicon Valley and other technology hubs evinces that the people who create such products see their work as a type of “digital crack cocaine”.</p>

        <p>In 2009, he wrote a top 10 Law and Economics article on SSRN "When is a Nudge a Shove?" describing how the guiding political philosophy of Facebook "libertarian paternalism" uses a variety of mind-controlling techniques to coerce users into engaging in personally destructive behaviors. Although his beliefs have evolved since then, he believes that the techniques used by Facebook and other social media sites have their origins in fascist regimes.</p>

        <p>As a result, he decided to pursue a career advocating for a ban on advertising revenue for social media companies.</p>
      
        <p>As a part of this initiative, he founded 6180, a mobile application dedicated to showing that earning revenue from data storage would be less personally and societally destructive than earning money from advertising.</p>
